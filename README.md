# Weather Python APIs

The three insights that this assignment showed me about how weather changes as you approach the equator are:

1.  As cities get closer to the equator they get hotter. 
2.  The hottest places seem to be just north of the equator. 
3.  Humidity, wind spead and cloudiness are not correlated with latitude.
